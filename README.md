## About

<b>Speed.AI - LLM Edition</b> is an Android app designed to benchmark Large Language Models (LLMs). It measures key performance indicators such as tokens per second and CPU/GPU/RAM usage. The benchmarks are conducted using a standardized dataset for all models, ensuring consistent input conditions. Additionally, the app allows for custom conversations with any supported model, providing benchmarking results afterward.

## Get Started


This app is built on the MLC LLM Android app. Therefore, the instructions and steps for building and running the app are identical to those of the MLC LLM app. To get started, follow this [documentation](https://llm.mlc.ai/docs/).
